This website is my personal portfolio, built to document and showcase the projects I’m most proud of. It serves as a living record of my work across software, automation, and AI, with an emphasis on clarity, speed, and long-term maintainability.

The site is intentionally content-driven, allowing projects and write-ups to be added or updated through MDX without touching the core layout or components.

### Why this exists

I wanted a portfolio that prioritizes signal over noise — fast to load, easy to maintain, and focused on the work itself rather than heavy visuals or gimmicks.
